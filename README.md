## 👋 Hi there, and
![abstractheader](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfa9ce1c-8f42-4649-b7e9-d8781a4b36e2)

I’m a software engineering student, currently studying to get my Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science with a specialization in Software Technology at Linnaeus University.

🖥️ Throughout my education, I’ve worked on scaled full-stack projects (all written mostly in Java, often using Git and Agile/SCRUM workflows), where I've learnt things like UI-design in JavaFX and database management in MySQL. I've also made lots of smaller Java and Python projects for courses like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures, and more.

⚙️ I’ve built personal projects in languages like Python, Go, Rust, and some web development in NextJS/React. You can take a look at some of these on my profile!

🐍 Two years into my education I switched from Windows to Linux (Arch), so I'm familiar with both systems when it comes to development. I'm really into the Linux and the ricing community, and you can see my dotfiles for my Arch Linux + Hyprland setup on my profile as well.

📚 Beyond the code, I’ve picked up solid foundations in computer networks (using technologies like GNS3), computer security, and databases through my studies.

🤝 Enjoy the rest of your day!
