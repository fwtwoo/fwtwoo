## 👋 Hi there, and
![abstractheader](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfa9ce1c-8f42-4649-b7e9-d8781a4b36e2)

Hey, I’m Ebbe — a software engineering student who’s really into coding, building things, and working on all types of systems!

🖥️ I’ve worked on both frontend and backend projects, from designing UI in JavaFX to managing MySQL databases.

⚙️ I’ve built personal projects in NextJS/React, and I’m comfortable working in Linux environments — it’s where I spend most of my time (Arch, btw...).

🐍 I also enjoy writing Rust and Go programs for smaller tools, and I’ve built larger object-oriented applications in Java, often using Git and SCRUM workflows.

📚 Beyond the code, I’ve picked up solid foundations in networks, computer security, and databases through my studies.

🚀 I'm always looking to learn more, push my skills, and team up with others to create cool, useful stuff.

🤝 If you want to build something, let’s connect!
